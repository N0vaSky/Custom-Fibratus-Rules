description: >
  Detects aggressive file encryption activity consistent with Thanos ransomware. This rule fires when a process (grouped by ps.uuid)
  first issues a CreateFile event with a SUPERSEDE disposition and create_options including NON_DIRECTORY_FILE and OPEN_REPARSE_POINT that fails
  with "The process cannot access," immediately followed (within 500ms) by a WriteFile event writing data to a file whose name ends with .crypted.
  Such a rapid sequence indicates an attempted in-place encryption of a user file.
